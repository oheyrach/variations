                <h1> Auguries of Innocence </h1>

                <p> by William Blake </p>
              
              <div class="items float-container container">
                <div class="left-block">
              
                    <div class="item am-block">
                      
                      <br> To see a World in a Grain of Sand 
                      <br> And a Heaven in a Wild Flower 
                      <br> Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 
                      <br> And Eternity in an hour 
                      
                      <br>

                      <br> A Robin Red breast in a Cage 
                      <br> Puts all Heaven in a Rage 
                      <br> A Dove house filld with Doves & Pigeons
                      <br> Shudders Hell thr' all its regions 

                      <br>

                      <br> A dog starvd at his Masters Gate
                      <br> Predicts the ruin of the State 
                      <br> A Horse misusd upon the Road
                      <br> Calls to Heaven for Human blood

                      <br>

                      <br> Each outcry of the hunted Hare 
                      <br> A fibre from the Brain does tear 
                      <br> A Skylark wounded in the wing 
                      <br> A Cherubim does cease to sing 

                      <br>
                    
                      <br> The Game Cock clipd & armd for fight
                      <br> Does the Rising Sun affright 
                      <br> Every Wolfs & Lions howl
                      <br> Raises from Hell a Human Soul

                      <br>
                    
                      <br> The wild deer, wandring here & there 
                      <br> Keeps the Human Soul from Care
                      <br> The Lamb misusd breeds Public Strife
                      <br> And yet forgives the Butchers knife

                      <br>
                    
                      <br> The Bat that flits at close of Eve
                      <br> Has left the Brain that wont Believe
                      <br> The Owl that calls upon the Night
                      <br> Speaks the Unbelievers fright
                      
                      <br> 

                      <br> He who shall hurt the little Wren
                      <br> Shall never be belovd by Men
                      <br> He who the Ox to wrath has movd
                      <br> Shall never be by Woman lovd

                      <br>
                    
                      <br> The wanton Boy that kills the Fly
                      <br> Shall feel the Spiders enmity
                      <br> He who torments the Chafers Sprite
                      <br> Weaves a Bower in endless Night 
    
                      <br>
                    
                      <br> The Catterpiller on the Leaf
                      <br> Repeats to thee thy Mothers grief
                      <br> Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly
                      <br> For the Last Judgment draweth nigh
